# Meet Firefox

![Meet Firefox screenshot](screenshot.png)

A silly project I did in my first semester of college (2008) with two other guys
for my [E-Communication][1] course with the purpose of promoting Firefox.
Firefox was the best browser back then.

Also see [my individual homework][2] for the first part of the course.
